# Overview:
The project will be on predicting the Saudi stock market index (TASI) using machine learning. This project will continue later after this course to draft a paper. The project is based on a paper by Patel et.al. (2015) where he used machine learning techniques to predict two stock market indices CNX Nifty and S&P Bombay stock exchange.

# Data Description:
 Initially, the data will be daily from 2010 until 2021 of TASI index since the Saudi stock market has changed in structure in the past 10 years. Predictor variables are taken from Patel et.al (2015) which are the following:
•	Simple 10 days moving average.
•	Weighted 10 days moving average.
•	Momentum Stochastic K%
•	Stochastic D%
•	Relative strength index (RSI)
•	Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)
•	Larry William’s R%
•	A/D (Accumulation/Distribution) oscillator
•	CCI (commodity channel index).
More variables might be added later or exchanged as the study progressed. 
Num. of Samples (Training: Validation: Test): around 2610
